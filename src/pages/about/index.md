        'To achieve this, participation from every corner of the industry is
        paramount. That includes data, input and opinions from every step in the
        supply chain, including the most important constituency: the consumer.'

        The end result will be improvement in sustainability, processing,
        product innovations and new value for everyone.

  title: THE STORY OF VYLA
  heading: >
    Connecting the farmer and the consumer by making the supply chain completely
    transparent.

        'For generations, children have asked that same question: “where does
        milk come from?” One answer has always sufficed: “from cows.” But that’s
        not enough anymore. Consumers want to know the real origins of their
        food. And those who supply it have a message - Doing dairy means doing
        good.'
    - text: >
        That’s why three of the world’s leading and forward-thinking dairy
        companies - Nestle, Land O’ Lakes and Lely Group -
        have partnered to raise the standard for the industry. Together with
        launch partner Nestlé, they bring their individual strengths to the
        creation of a new and entirely different technology company.
    - text: >
        That company is VYLA - created as an independent and impartial
        accelerator of transparency, sustainability and innovation in the dairy
        industry. After all, the new questions are entirely fair. Where was the
        farm? How were the cows treated? How was this milk processed? Has
        anything been added? Were sustainable practices used? How did it get to
        my store?

        With VYLA, answers to these questions are just the start.
