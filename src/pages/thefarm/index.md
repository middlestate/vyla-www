  heading: >
    Connecting the farmer and the consumer by making the supply chain completely transparent.

    - text: >
        'For generations, children have asked that same question: “where does milk come from?” One answer has always sufficed: “from cows.” But that’s not enough anymore. Consumers want to know the real origins of their food. And those who supply it have a message - Doing dairy means doing good.'
    - text: >
        That’s why three of the world’s leading and forward-thinking dairy companies - Nestle, Land O’ Lakes and Lely Group - have partnered to raise the standard for the industry. Together with launch partner Nestlé, they bring their individual strengths to the creation of a new and entirely different technology company.
    - text: >
        That company is VYLA - created as an independent and impartial accelerator of transparency, sustainability and innovation in the dairy industry. After all, the new questions are entirely fair. Where was the farm? How were the cows treated? How was this milk processed? Has anything been added? Were sustainable practices used? How did it get to my store?

        With VYLA, answers to these questions are just the start.
